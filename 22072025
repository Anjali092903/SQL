1:-  A retail e-commerce company called "ShopEasy" has an online platform where customers can buy products from various categories like electronics, clothing, home appliances etc.. 
They have been tracking customer purchase behavior over several years through their relational database management system which uses SQL syntax.
The database has two tables 'customer' table with customer id(cid),name,email,idate(YYYYMMDD),last_visit_date(YYYYMMDD);
another 'order' table having order_id(oid),customer_id(cid),order_date(YYYYMMDD),product_category(pcat).
Write an SQL Query which would help identify top3 product categories selling most items along with total revenue earned(including tax ) across each categoryAbruptly stopping date
September30th2020.Also display sum gainedfrom non electronic items during lock down period(March15th2020toJune30th2020).

You need write only SQL query no execution snippets please use proper indentation note you might require(!!)selfjoinsandaggregatefunctions/sql clauseforbettervisibility

ANSWER:- 
-- Top 3 Product Categories by Items Sold and Total Revenue (up to Sept 30, 2020)
SELECT 
    o.pcat AS product_category,
    COUNT(o.oid) AS total_items_sold,
    SUM(p.price_with_tax) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    "order" o
JOIN 
    product p ON o.oid = p.order_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date <= '20200930'
GROUP BY 
    o.pcat
ORDER BY 
    total_items_sold DESC
LIMIT 3;


-- Sum of Revenue from Non-Electronic Items During Lockdown Period
SELECT 
    SUM(p.price_with_tax) AS non_electronics_lockdown_revenue
FROM 
    "order" o
JOIN 
    product p ON o.oid = p.order_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date BETWEEN '20200315' AND '20200630'
    AND o.pcat <> 'electronics';


EXPLANATION:- 

Query 1: Top 3 Product Categories (Up to 30-Sep-2020)
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    o.pcat AS product_category,
    COUNT(o.oid) AS total_items_sold,
    SUM(p.price_with_tax) AS total_revenue
Selects each product category

Counts how many orders are placed (COUNT(oid))

Calculates total revenue with tax (SUM(price_with_tax))

sql
Copy
Edit
FROM "order" o
JOIN product p ON o.oid = p.order_id
Joins order with assumed product table using order_id

sql
Copy
Edit
WHERE o.order_date <= '20200930'
Restricts records up to September 30, 2020

sql
Copy
Edit
GROUP BY o.pcat
ORDER BY total_items_sold DESC
LIMIT 3;
Groups by category

Orders by count (items sold) in descending order

Picks top 3 selling categories

🔍 Query 2: Non-Electronics Revenue During Lockdown
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    SUM(p.price_with_tax) AS non_electronics_lockdown_revenue
Sums all revenue from non-electronic categories

sql
Copy

FROM "order" o
JOIN product p ON o.oid = p.order_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date BETWEEN '20200315' AND '20200630'
    AND o.pcat <> 'electronics';
Filters dates during lockdown

Excludes electronics category with <>
